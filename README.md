**A UnityColorPicker clone that runs in the scene**

This was made with 2021.3.16f1 using Standard Render Pipeline, this repo does not include an alt version of the gradient shader/material for URP yet.

A demo scene (DemoScene1.unity) is included in the Assets\Scenes folder.  If you are dropping the prefab into another scene, make sure an EventSystem object exists in the scene.
